# EDArcade

**What is it?**

A 2D 360 degree top-down endless scroller based on Elite Dangerous.

**Why is it?**

Because I like Elite Dangerous, and figured we needed a 2D arcade version. Seemed like a decent challenge for a first game attempt.

*But first... credit where it's due*

* This project descended from a Boids JavaScript implementation from Shane Hudson's book [Javascript Creativity](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z6ThAwAAQBAJ)
* I lifted the ship graphics from [elite-dangerous.wikia.com](http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Ships?file=EJwFwVEOwiAMANC7cABKywpxV_BHj0AYYZjNEqgfxuzuvvczn3GY1eyqfa4AW5tZxmanyki12CpSj5J6mzbLCUk15f0sb52AxOgCk3c-xoDsA2D0SM7RbWGiiAEjPDjfv89mX72a6w_7qyIR._2SoJRAPMgASbMzsNpw66yQhCqo.jpg)
* The explosion effect came from [Sarah Carmody](https://dribbble.com/sarahcarmody)'s [1925630-Explosion](https://dribbble.com/shots/1925630-Explosion)
* The scrolling starfield background image is from [1-background.com](https://1-background.com/stars_1.htm)
* And more [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) heroes than you can shake a pointy stick at
